### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

The Mastra playground will be available at the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:4111).

### Testing Enhanced Features

```bash
# Test enhanced workflow with all features
npm run workflow:test-enhanced
